Lab Setup:

Materials:
30/30, 5mm grid points calibration sheet
- use 10 grid spaces = 50mm, figure out pixels vs uncertainty.


First take a blank image without calibration sheet
- take another image with calibration sheet

Start Sequence: Power, hydraulic, then hold run button to start wind tunnel.

First run, pressure set as approximately Mach 3.

We do a shadow graph for each Mach, vertical Schleren, horizontal schleren.
